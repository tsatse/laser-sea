A shoot'em-up game

This is work in progress with currently a lot of debug display.
I've coded this with the 'one game fits a floppy disk' model. And I confess there's a lot of premature optimization here.
Like throwing away OOP :)

Anyway, I needed to put this idea into code. Maybe it will turn out fun.
